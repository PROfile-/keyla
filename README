To compile the source code with Visual Studio, copy the contents of one of "projects" directories to the source code root directory (i.e., the directory that contains directories "keyla", "NSIS installer", etc.).  Then open solution file that will be placed in the source code root directory. WARNING: copy files carefully because of those ".svn" folders hidden everywhere.
