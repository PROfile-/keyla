These diagrams may help you to understand the code.

DESCRIPTION

"Initialization" illustrates the order of initialization of program's components
during startup. "Shutdown" illustrates how the components are turned off when
the program is shutting down. "Interaction" illustrates components' interaction
when the program is working.

LEGEND

solid arrows - methods' invocation
dashed arrows - data transfer
dotted arrows - implementation detail

The more left a component is placed at "Initialization" / "Shutdown" diagrams,
the earlier it gets initialized / turned off.

SOFTWARE USED

In order to generate the diagrams I manually filled *.dot files and applied
GraphViz(http://www.graphviz.org/) to them. Here are the commands used:

> neato initialization.dot -T pdf -o initialization.pdf
> neato shutdown.dot -T pdf -o shutdown.pdf
> dot interaction.dot -T pdf -o interaction.pdf

Syntax of *.dot files is described at http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php
(see "User's Guides" section).
